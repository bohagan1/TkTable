**** v1.4 Feb 2 1997 **** (changes jhobbs@cs.uoregon.edu)

Changed default unix font to medium weight (from bold).

Updated "bbox" method to allow range.

Added auto-resizable border code with new "border" method, TableAtBorder
function and new Table bindings.

Changed TableCellHidden to TableCellVCoords & extended it.  Now understands
highlightWidth variation and clips area to actual visible coords.

Added code in TableConfigure to prevent spurious redisplays of the
entire table for any config request.

fixed index bug where "ROW,COL<extrajunk>" translated to "ROW,COL" and
a couple other similar interpretive bugs.

fixed potential segfault in unsetting "active" element of attached array.

changed min()/max() to MIN()/MAX() - avoids Windoze warning.

changed textCurPosn to icursor.

greatly simplified KANJI interoperability by making activeBuf a regular
char *, changing a few interfaces, and some other stuff.  This reduced
the number of KANJI #ifdef's significantly.

added -command and -usecommand options.

**** v1.3 Jan 28 1997 **** (changes jhobbs@cs.uoregon.edu)

Included precompiled Win95/Tk8.0a2 DLL.

Fixed several compiler warning problems.

Moved header code to its own header file.

Fixed some potential mem leaks.

Added Windows support.  HACK ALERT!  Without an XSetClipRectangles, an
extra Drawable is used for WIN32.  There may be a better way to do this.
If so, make me a patch.

Data struct / Cmd name changes to avoid any conflict when compiling older
version of Table with newer version in same executable.

Added -image option to tags.

Removed NO_TOP_LEFT ifdef'ed code.  Topleft should be showing.

**** v1.2 Jan 18 1997 **** (changes jhobbs@cs.uoregon.edu)

Updated man page and HTML help page.

Added TableCellSort to sort a row,col properly.

Added arg for curvalue method to set the current active buffer.

Added validation mechanism, validate method and -validate, -validatecommand
options.  See docs for details.

Added "active" key element to traced Tcl array for table.  This holds
the activeBuf value of the table.

Change arrayVar configuration in TableConfigure to only trigger if
the arrayVar actually changed.

Moved inserting/deleting in active cell to separate functions and
bullet-proofed the code.

Removed TableFlashConfigure.  Not used since "flash" became permanent tag.

Changed TableSetCellValue to only set the variable if the value
has changed.  This will prevent spurious flashing.

Removed Roland King's COPYRIGHT, replaced with acknowledgements.
This code represents a 90% rewrite of his original code.

Added -O as default CFLAGS in Makefile.in, along with HP cc note.

Fixed bug with cursor at position 0 for KANJI (appears to be a bug
in TkWSTextExtents).

Get/Set variable overhaul to ensure that everything works correctly
for KANJI support (without compile warnings).

Changed TableBufLengthen to a #define which uses ckrealloc.

Removed -rowfirstmode and its use in code.  It actually didn't work for
many functions and indices would be incorrectly returned.
	**** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBLITY ****

Fixed handling of arrayVar to accept vars with funny chars (including spaces).

Added "see active" to tkTableMoveCell.

Changed calculation of hidden cell to require at least 3/4 of
the cell to be off the screen.

Cleaned up, optimized lots of code.  Cleaned up some memory leaks.

Removed undocumented "setlist" functionality - it was never used
and I deemed it extraneous.

Numerous name changes in tkTable.tcl (conforming to standards).  Also
added full row/col selection capability && cut/copy/paste functionality.
	**** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBLITY ****

Changed ".table get ..." to return items in the same way as that
of listbox (only affects handling of spaced values being returned).
	**** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBLITY ****

Changed Table_GetIndex to TableGetIndex (it was the only _ func).

Optimized calling of TableAdjustParams in [xy]view and scan dragto
as well as TAP code.

Removed useless selectionOn C var and "select" index.
	**** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBLITY ****

Changed the [xy]scrollcmd to receive Tk4+ style args (2 doubles
instead of 4 ints).

Fixed problems with [xy]view and scan.  Might not be perfect yet.
Removed boundary command as it reiterates [yx]view and index,
added "bottomright" special index.  Change of code example:
    .table bound bottom	=>	.table index bottomright row|col
	**** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBLITY ****

Fixed problem with cursor not disappearing on focus out.

Added -browsecommand option for monitoring active cell movement.

Added selection handler and -rowseparator, -colseparator,
-selectioncommand, -exportselection options.

Fixed problem with changing var to a simple variable.

Fixed problems with compiling for KANJI, now seems to work again.

Fixed highlight border bug. (bruecker)

Fixed typo that prevented IMP from working.

**** v1.1 Dec 30 1996 **** (changes jhobbs@cs.uoregon.edu)

Updated code to handle Tk8 font mechanism.  Now works with Tk8.

Added Tktable_SafeInit procedure so it could be loaded into a safe
interpreter.

Integrated Bruecker's (peter@bj-ig.de) changes to 0.63:
  - Moved IMP-Code to one place, needs testing.
  - Some changes to TableCreate and TableDestroy:
      Hashtables ever needed are created in Create 
      so no tests in configure and later needed.
  - Removed GcCache (will be placed in TableDisplay)
  - Repaired Focus-Code little bug remains in the right
    and bottom of HL-Frame.
  
Updated README to reflect file name changes.

Changed tkAppInit.c to reflect tk4.2 appinit.

Changed Makefile.in to support get X_INCLUDES right.

**** v1.0 Dec 19 1996 **** (changes jhobbs@cs.uoregon.edu)

BUMPED VERSION TO 1.0 for initial (re)release.

Updated man pages, in particular documenting bindings.

Updated tkTable.tcl to use origin where appropriate.

Added origin index.

Added extra arg to insert/delete to specify what is really being
inserted/deleted to/from.

Corrected insert/delete/icursor to not do edit the active cell if
it has not been set yet.

Fixed TableScanTo.

Enabled the display of the topleft title cells.

Fixed cursor constraint for oversized fonts in a row.

**** v0.63 Dec 18 96 **** (changes jhobbs@cs.uoregon.edu)

Removed TableSetCell from tkTable.tcl, rearranged bindings as well.

Rewrote checkTagCmd, fixed spurious return values.

Reordered trigger path for Table_GetIndex.

Fixed see to not be forceful, but to only move if necessary, and to
use the +1,+1 offset from topleft (more like centering).

Added topleft index.

ellson patch:
	Fixed package require in Makefile.in and demo files
	Moved Table_GetIndex to avoid implicit declaration warning.

Changed how "anchor" was indexed internally.

Fixed cursor showing in an active cell of width 0.

Removed check for bounds in SEL_CLEAR (SEL_SET did it for us).

**** v0.62 Dec 18 96 **** (changes jhobbs@cs.uoregon.edu)

Updated man pages.

Removed "#ifdef KANJI0" code (it was useless).

Added in use of the active tag (it was previously ignored).

Removed restriction on see method that kept the active cell in the view.

Changed xview/yview/scan methods to not adjust selRow/Col.

Changed code to use active cell as active, rather then sel cell.

Made "flash" tag have higher display priority than "sel".

Added pattern match support for "tag names".

Added "tag exists" and "tag cget" submethods.

Changed "tag celltag" to use Table_GetIndex instead of sscanf

**** v0.61 patch Dec 14 96 **** (ellson@lucent.com)

Change "tag celltag" to use index form of cell address,"x,y" instead of list
form "{x y}"

Add back support for zero width columns and zero height rows.

Added installation of tkTable.tcl in 
   [lindex $tcl_pkgPath 0]/Tktable/tkTable.tcl
(0.61 was using the built-in copy of tkTable.tcl so the lack of
installation wasn't noticed.   Perhaps we don't need the built-in
version???)  I put the runtime script in this directory to make it 
trivial to generate binary distributions of the widget consisting of 
a single Tktable directory that is just dropped into lib/.

Added a make target for tablewish (not normally needed with dynamic loading
but sometimes handy for debugging)

Corrected package name (Wasn't loading from tkcon Interp->Packages menu.
Package name should start with capital letter to match Init entry point.)

Added configure code to automatically discover --prefix from existing
tclsh installation.  Installation is now simply:
      ./configure
      make install

**** v0.61 Dec 13 96 **** (all changes jhobbs except noted)

Updated, corrected, expanded man pages.

Updated internal code comments, fixed result strings.

Fixed see problem (reported by Jean-Paul).

Removed getwidth && getheight and rewrote width && height to be more
flexible and subsume the previous methods.

Changed flashtime to really be a number representing 1/4 sec and
changed the default to 3 (750ms).  Added "flash" as a permanent tag
(like "title", "active", and "sel").  Added options:
	-flashmode
	-flashtime

Changed "Title" tag to "title".  Why cap it?

Reformatted most code to fit in 80 cols.

Fixed activate index offset bug.

Changed -*title options to -title*.  The original version was too
misleading as to its purpose.

Added fixes from ellson@lucent.com.
	test.tcl updates
	SIGSEV bug from improper argc count

Added some changes from peter@bj-ig.de.
	New stretch modes LAST && FILL
	Highlight/Focus fixes
	More options instead of methods

Improved curselection code.

added the following options:
	-autoclear	replaces editmode method
	-state		replaces editmode method
	-insert*	from Tk entry, manipulate cursor style
	-batchmode	replaces batch method

Changed the dynamic load path for tkTable.tcl from
"$tk_library/tkTable/tkTable.tcl" to "$tk_library/tkTable.tcl".

**** v0.60 Dec 10 96 **** (all changes jhobbs)
OPTIONS:
 
Altered man pages to properly reflect what options are handled (there
were numerous extra, plus many missing).
 
changed -procrowtag => -rowtagcommand
changed -proccoltag => -coltagcommand
 
Added -bd synonym
 
Fixed all internal coding for readability, concise representation
 
changed -cursorbg => -insertbackground
 
METHODS:

Fixed lack of break in CMD_*STRETCH
 
removed whatcell:  code change:
        .table whatcell x y     => .table index @x,y
 
removed whereis, changed to bbox:  code change:
        .table whereis row col  => .table bbox <index>
This needs to be improved to take multiple indices.
 
removed toprow && leftcol, added boundary:  code change:
        .table leftcol|toprow|bottomrow|rightcol ?rowOrCol?
        =>
        .table boundary left|right|top|bottom ?rowOrCol?
rowOrCol can only be specified for top|left, as appropriate (though
a bug in the code didn't check properly).
 
removed [rc]index: code change:
        .table [rc]index <index>        => .table index <index> row|col
 
changed get so (1) it works and (2) it returns values more like the
listbox command
 
removed setcell.  This has been subsumed by the improved selection method.
code likeness:
        .table setcell          => .table index select
        OR                      => .table curselection
        .table setcell 4 2      => .table selection set 4,2
The "index select" is there for 100% compatibility, but curselection is
what should be used to properly represent all selected cells.
 
MISC:
 
fixed parse_command to handle full non-ambiguous method names
 
updated man pages to include all methods/options in Tk4 style.

reordered a lot of code to be in "alphabetical" order.

**** v0.4p8 ****
   - added patch from wangnick@orthogon.de to make tkTable accept -rows 0
   - added patch from tmoore@pnfi.forestry.ca for handling of bad
     array indexes
   - added patch from tmoore@pnfi.forestry.ca to add rowTagProc and
     colTagProc
   - added patch from ellson@lucent.com to support cget so that
     tkTable can be used with the dragdrop extension by
     fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk (Donal K. Fellows).

version 0.1 --> version 0.2
---------------------------
Changed the tag code to apply the effects of multiple tags to a cell.

when the cursor was moved

Thanks particularly to Lou Salkind for pointing out some of the above
and suggesting fixes.
