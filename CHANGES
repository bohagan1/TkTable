version 0.1 --> version 0.2
---------------------------
Changed the tag code to apply the effects of multiple tags
to a cell. 

Fixed a bug with the flash code which forgot to delete the 
flash when a table was deleted

Fixed a bug which meant that row, column and cell tag changes
didn't update to the screen immediately when there was a row
or column offset.

Fixed the anchor code which was adding/subtracting a pixel
from the string in certain circumstances

Fixed a cursor movement bug which caused the same cell to
appear twice when the cursor was moved

Thanks particularly to Lou Salkind for pointing out some of the 
above and suggesting fixes.
