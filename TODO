## TODO LIST

These are recommendations, not all of the same priority, and not
all necessarily will be implemented.  If you see something you
feel is important, email me and say so.  Very democratic.
Aside from here, see header of tkTable.c for other stuff, especially BUGS.

*** Tcl8 object model will be supported when it is supported in Tk
    (or somewhere else that has good examples for widgets)

* match entry width with cell width (off by PADX PADY)

* -rowstretchmode fill ignores initial # of rows, or config requests for more.

* add -colstretchmode fill

* scratch -fill in favor of -dynamic which would monitor the max
  extent of row/col (difficult)

* fix selection routines to properly handle title area movement

* multi-line support (newlines are only handled effectively in Tk8)

* support smooth scrolling of rows/cols

* possible -fill option for tags/cells (col/rowspan idea)
 
* add ability to index by tagname

* fix AdjustParams to use col/rowstretch properly when only a portion
  of the table is visible (ie: when using scrollbars)

* overhaul tag mechanism (include way to query for tags on a cell, add
  priority, allow indices like 2,*)
