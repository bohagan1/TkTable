Windows support
  Out-of-the-box.  This should be available by v1.5.
  We have the code, but it needs to be exercised appropriately.
  We will probably distribute a precompiled DLL.

Generic callback mechanism
  This would enable you to specify a procedure to call when editing
  a (set of) cell(s), for validation or whatever.

Validation mechanism
  Mutually exclusive with callback mechanism, this would allow you to
  be able to specify certain cells as a specific type (int, real, alpha)
