* Type specification mechanism (low priority)
  Mutually exclusive with validation mechanism, this would allow you to
  be able to specify certain cells as a specific type (int, real, alpha)

* Add ability to index by tagname

* row/col resize by clicking on border (tcl solution)
* separators in title areas for adjusting the width/height

* improve cut/paste to delete/insert rows/cols

* procedural interface for cells via -command (low priority)

* To use the Tk-GC-Cache we must reserve our Tags-GC's
	tablePtr->normalGC = TableGetGc(tablePtr,&tablePtr->defaultTag);
  the Use-Count is ge 1 in TkGc. The Tag-Mixing is a problem but not
  normally if we have preserved Gc's for normal/selected/title.

* localize code for arrayVar/Trace/Configuration to one place, one
  set of routines.

* fix AdjustParams to use col/rowstretch properly when only a portion
  of the table is visible (ie: when using scrollbars)
