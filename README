		*************************************
		  The Tk Table Widget Version 1.0+
		*************************************

INTRODUCTION

This is the first release of a table/matrix widget as an extension
to tk/tcl. The basic features of the widget are:

 * variable width columns / height rows
 * row and column titles
 * attaches to a Tcl array variable
 * supports standard TK reliefs, fonts, etc.
 * x/y scrollbar support
 * has 'tag' styles per row, column or cell to change
   colo(u)rs, font, relief or anchor position
 * in-cell editing - returns value back to array
 * support for disabled (read-only) tables
 * multiple selection modes, with "active" cell
 * 3 drawing modes to get optimal performance for larger tables
   or slower machines.
 * optional 'flashes' when things update
 * can be configured to 'stretch' rows and columns to fill an
   enclosing widget
 * support for Tk Kanji patch
 * Windows support

BUILDING THE WIDGET

1. Uncompress and unpack the distribution

	gzip -d tkTable<version>.tar.gz
	tar -xf tkTable<version>.tar

   This will create a subdirectory tkTable<version> with all the files in it.
   There is a precompiled DLL built on Win95/VC4/Tk8.0a2.  Everyone else will
   have to configure and compile.

2. Configure

        cd tkTable<version>
	./configure --prefix=/usr/local --exec-prefix=/usr/local

   tkTable uses information left in tkConfig.sh when you built tk.  This
   file will be found in $exec_prefix/lib/.  For Win95/NT, hack up
   makefile.vc until it works and compile.  It never worked 100% because
   I couldn't execute wish80 from a path with a space in it, but the DLL
   builds just fine.

3. Make and Install

	make
	make install

   tkTable is built to comply to the latest tcl package conventions.

4. Use it

   Start a regular wish interpreter, load the library, and use the table.
   Or use the "tablewish" interpreter that has tktable built in.  There
   are a few test scripts in the demos directory which you can source.
   The one called basic.tcl will create a table, fill an array
   and attach it to the table.  It also demonstrates the use scrollbars
   and fixed titles.  One of the cells will change a few moments later
   and you will see the cell flash.

   This widget is not compatible with versions below 0.60.  Please see
   the notes in UPGRADING if you used a previous release of tkTable.

5. Read the manpage

   There is a manpage that briefly describes the commands the widget will
   understand and respond to. The best way is just to try them out.


THINGS TO WATCH OUT FOR

Packing
  The table tries not to allocate huge chunks of screen real estate if
  you ask it for a lot of rows and columns.  You can always stretch out
  the frame or explicitly tell it how big it can be.  If you want to
  stretch the table, remember to pack it with fill both and expand on.

Array   
  The array elements for the table are of the form array(2,3) etc.  Make
  sure there are no spaces around the ','.  You may have negative indices

Editing
  If you can't edit, remember that the focus model in tk is explicit, so
  you need to click on the table or give it the focus command.  Just
  having a selected cell is not the same thing as being able to edit.
  You also need the editing cursor.  If you can't get the cursor, make
  sure that you actually have a variable assigned to the table.

COMMENTS, BUGS, etc.

* Please can you send comments and bug reports to jhobbs@cs.uoregon.edu or
  ellson@lucent.com and we'll do our best at addressing them.  This
  is not a primary project for any of the authors.

* If you find a bug, a short piece of Tcl that exercises it would be very
  useful, or even better, compile with debugging and specify where it
  crashed in that short piece of Tcl.
